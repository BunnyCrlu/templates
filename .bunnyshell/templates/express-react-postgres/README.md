# Template overview

This Environment [Template](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/templates-what-are-templates) is a boilerplate for creating a new environment based on a stack using Node.js with Express for the backend, React with Typescript for the frontend and PostgreSQL as the database.

The template provides the Bunnyshell configuration composed of 3 Components (frontend + backend + database) and the CRUD application that demonstrates how the components work together to form an environment.

You can extend the template by further adding Components, be them more APIs or other services, such as queues, caches, block storage etc.

# Environment overview

An [Environment in Bunnyshell](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/environments) is a user-defined group that brings together applications and all of the services and databases those applications require.

This Environment Template contains 3 components:
- `app` for frontend, based on a `node` image
- `api` for backend, also based on a `node` image
- `db` using a `postgres` image

and 1 persistent volume:
- `data-volume`

## Container images

The images for both frontend and backend have 2 possible stages: `dev` and `prod`.

The `dev` stage is suitable for development, as it contains development packages and libraries and has debugging enabled.  
The `prod` stage is meant for production/staging, as it produces an optimizied image, as lightweight as possible.

The stage (`dev` or `prod`) can be set from the Environment's configuration (`bunnyshell.yaml`), within each Component's `dockerCompose.build.target` property. The default is `dev`, and it can be changed to `prod` to produce production-like images.

# How to use this Template

You can create Environments from a [Bunnyshell Template](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/templates-what-are-templates); these Environments can have multiple purposes:
- Development
- Staging / Dev testing / End-to-end testing

Development Environments should be created with the `dev` target for images (see "Container images") and can be used for Remote Development.

Staging / Testing Environments should be created with the `prod` target for images, in order to have the application running as it does in production.

&nbsp;

## Staging / Testing

For staging / testing purposes, the Environments just need to be deployed.

You need to ensure that the `dockerCompose.build.target` is set to `prod` for all the Components, and then [deploy the Environment](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/environment-workflows-deploy).

&nbsp;

## Remote Development

[Remote Development](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development) allows you to develop directly in a cloud environment, therefore eliminating all inconsistencies and approximations of traditional local environments.

The code is ran in a container running in Kubernetes, and you can choose one of two ways to work, depending whether you prefer to keep a local copy of the code or not.

1. You can have the code existing **only in the container** - you will need an IDE capable of connecting via SSH to install a headless IDE in the container, eg. VS Code or the JetBrains suite.

2. You can have the code existing **on your device** and it will be synchronized into the container - any IDE or plain text editor will do.

ðŸ“– For more information on how Remote Development works in Bunnyshell, please see the [dedicated documentation](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development).

ðŸ§± Remote Development can only be started from the CLI, so you will need to [install the Bunnyshell CLI](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/bunnyshell-cli-install) installed and to [authenticate in the CLI](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/bunnyshell-cli-authentication).

### Start a Remote Development session

In order to start a Remote Development session, you must run the dedicated command from the CLI:
```
bns remote-development up
```

The CLI will present a wizard, so you can choose your Environment first, then the Component on which you want to develop on.  
You can also pass on the Component ID, to skip the wizard. The full command can be copied from the UI: go to the Environment details screen, click the desired Component, then expand the *Component Actions* and select *Remote Development*.

ðŸ’¡ When typing, you can use the shorter alias: `bns rdev up`

ðŸ§± Please note that starting a Remote Development session requires the *Remote Development* setting to be *ON* for the Environment (*ON* is the default value).

You need to choose the way you wish to work with files, before starting the Remote Development session.

#### Working with code from your machine

When working with code stored locally (the default mode), you just need to run:
```
bns remote-development up
```

You need to provide 2 additional paths:
- the *local path*, for your local code files
- the *remote path*: the path where code files are located within the container (you can find this out from the `Dockerfile`)

ðŸ’¡ The wizard will require these from you, but you can also provide them as options, `-l` and `-r` respectively.

ðŸ“– For more information on starting and stopping a remote Development session, please see:
- [How to Start Remote Development](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-start)
  - [with local files](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-local-files)

#### Working with code from the container

When working directly with the files from the container, you need to disable the synchronization of files, by adding the option `--sync-mode none` to the command:
```
bns remote-development up --sync-mode none
```

You need to provide the *remote path*: the path where code files are located within the container (you can find this out from the `Dockerfile`).

ðŸ’¡ The wizard will require these from you, but you can also provide them as options, `-l` and `-r` respectively.

  - [with remote files](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-remote-files)

&nbsp;

### Stop a Remote Development session

In order to stop a Remote Development session, you must run the dedicated command from the CLI:
```
bns remote-development down
```

The CLI will present a wizard, so you can choose your Environment first, then the Component for which you want to stop the session for.  
You can also pass on the Component ID, to skip the wizard. The full command can be copied from the UI: go to the Environment details screen, click the desired Component, then expand the *Component Actions* and select *Remote Development*.
